# Javascript algorithms and data structures certification

[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)

## part 1

Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.
In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.
You'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

### class 1: Learn Basic JavaScript Building a Role Playing Game

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.
In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

### class 2: Learn form validation by build a calorie counter

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.
In this practice project, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.

### class 3: Learn basic string and array methods by build a music player

Now let's learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.
In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

### class 4: Learn the date object by building a date formatter

Woring with dates in Javascript can be challengeing. You have to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. In this object, you'll learn how to work with the Javasciprt Date Object, including its methods and propertis. You'll also learn how to correctly format dates.
This project will cover concepts such as the getDate(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods.

### certification 1

This is one of required projects to earn your certification.
For this project, you'll build an application that checks whether a given word is palindrome.

### class 5: Learn modern JavaScript methods by building a footeball team cards

One common aspect of building web application: proessing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.
This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.

### class 6: Learn localstorage by building a todo app

Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.
In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

### class 7: Learn recursion by building a decimal to binary converter

Recursion is a programing concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.
In this project. You'll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You'll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

### certification 2

This is one of required projects to earn your certification.
For this project, you'll build an application that converts integers to Roma numerals

### class 8: Learn basic algorithmic thinking by build a number sorter

In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.
This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.

### class 9: Learn advanced array methods by building a statistics calculator

As you expand your Javascript skills, you'll want to get comfortable with array manipulation methods, such as map(), reduce(), and filter().
In this statistics calculator project, you'll gain experience with handing user input, DOM manipulation, and methods chaining. You'll get practice by performing statistical calculations like mean, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
