# Javascript algorithms and data structures certification

    [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)
    Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.
    In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.
    You'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

## part 1

    level-1

### class 1: Learn Basic JavaScript Building a Role Playing Game

    JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.
    In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

### class 2: Learn form validation by build a calorie counter

    Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.
    In this practice project, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.

### class 3: Learn basic string and array methods by build a music player

    Now let's learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.
    In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

### class 4: Learn the date object by building a date formatter

    Woring with dates in Javascript can be challengeing. You have to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. In this object, you'll learn how to work with the Javasciprt Date Object, including its methods and propertis. You'll also learn how to correctly format dates.
    This project will cover concepts such as the getDate(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods.

### certification

    This is one of required projects to earn your certification.
    For this project, you'll build an application that checks whether a given word is palindrome.
